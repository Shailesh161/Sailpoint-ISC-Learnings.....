1] Automatic Scheduling (SailPoint Identity Processing)

### Automatic Identity Processing

* SailPoint **automatically runs identity processing twice a day**.
* Default schedule (set by SailPoint):

  * **8:00 AM CST/CDT**
  * **8:00 PM CST/CDT**
* During this process:

  * Identities are refreshed
  * Attribute changes are evaluated
  * Lifecycle events and access changes are applied

### Manual / Immediate Identity Processing

* Sometimes changes are needed **immediately** (e.g., new attribute mapping, lifecycle rule update).
* Instead of waiting for the scheduled run, we can trigger processing manually.

#### How to trigger manual processing:

1. Go to **Identity Profiles**
2. Open the required **Identity Profile**
3. Click on **Apply Changes**
4. This triggers **immediate identity processing** for affected identities

### Key Points

* Automatic scheduling is **system-managed** by SailPoint
* Manual processing is **admin-controlled**
* Useful when testing changes or handling urgent updates
